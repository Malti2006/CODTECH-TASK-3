##OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project: COMPILER DESIGN BASICS

Compiler design is the process of creating a compiler, which translates a high-level programming language (like C) into a low-level language (like machine code) that a computer can understand. C is often used to write compilers because it offers both performance and low-level access. The basic process involves breaking down the source code into smaller parts, analyzing its structure and meaning, and then generating the equivalent code in the target language.Complier design, in essence, is the process of building tools (compilers) that translate human-readable code (like C) into machine-readable code (like assembly or machine code). C is often used in compiler design, both as a source language (to be compiled) and as a language to implement the compiler itself. A compiler goes through various phases like lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization.

Phases of a Compiler:

The compiler breaks down the translation process into distinct stages:

1. Lexical Analysis:  Breaks the source code into tokens (identifiers, keywords, operators, etc.). 
2. Syntax Analysis (Parsing):  Verifies the grammatical structure of the code based on predefined rules (grammar) and builds a parse tree. 
3. Semantic Analysis:  Checks the meaning and consistency of the code, ensuring it makes sense semantically (e.g., type checking). 
4. Intermediate Code Generation:  Transforms the code into an intermediate representation (IR) that is machine-independent. 
5. Code Optimization:  Improves the intermediate code to make it more efficient (e.g., faster, smaller). 
6. Code Generation: Converts the optimized intermediate code into the target machine code.

Key Concepts
1. Tokens: Basic units of the programming language.
2. Grammar: Rules defining the structure of the programming language.
3. Parser: A program that analyzes the tokens and generates an AST.
4. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): A tree representation of the source code.

Compiler Design Techniques
1. Top-Down Parsing: Parsing the input from the top-level structure.
2. Bottom-Up Parsing: Parsing the input from the individual tokens.
3. Finite Automata: Used in lexical analysis to recognize tokens.

Compiler Tools
1. Lex: A lexical analyzer generator.
2. Yacc: A parser generator.

Benefits
1. Improved Code Quality: Compilers can optimize code for performance and efficiency.
2. Platform Independence: Compilers can generate code for different platforms.
